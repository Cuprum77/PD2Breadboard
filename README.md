# WORK IN PROGRESS - PD2Breadboard
Introducing the ultimate USB Power Delivery (PD) negotiator with unparalleled power measuring capabilities, powered by the cutting-edge RP2040 microcontroller. This isn't just any negotiator â€“ it's a powerful variable power supply that's perfect for powering your breadboard projects on the fly, with an onboard high-resolution graphical LCD and three-button interface for easy control.


Our RP2040 powered USB PD negotiator is the perfect solution for anyone looking for a versatile, on-the-go power supply for their breadboard projects. With its advanced negotiating algorithm, this negotiator ensures optimal power delivery to your projects, while its onboard power measuring capabilities provide detailed insights into your device's power consumption.


The onboard high-resolution graphical LCD and three-button interface make it easy to control and monitor your device's power usage. With the graphical LCD, you can quickly view your device's power consumption and adjust the voltage levels to your desired level with the three-button interface.


Whether you're prototyping a new project, experimenting with electronics, or just need a reliable power source for your breadboard, our negotiator has you covered. It's capable of delivering up to 100W of power, with adjustable voltage levels ranging from 3.3V to 20V, making it compatible with a wide range of projects and devices.


And with its onboard power measuring capabilities, you'll have unprecedented insights into your device's power consumption. This feature is especially useful for those looking to optimize their device's power usage, or for those who want to monitor the power consumption of their projects in real-time.


Our RP2040 powered USB PD negotiator is also incredibly easy to use. Simply plug it into your USB port, set the voltage to your desired level using the graphical LCD and three-button interface, and let it power your breadboard project with ease. And with its compact, lightweight design, you can take it with you anywhere you go.


So why settle for a limited, fixed power supply when you can have the ultimate USB PD negotiator with onboard power measuring capabilities, variable voltage levels, and an onboard high-resolution graphical LCD and three-button interface? Take your breadboard projects to the next level!
